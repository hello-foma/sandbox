# Navigation by stacks
[Preview in browser](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hello-foma/sandbox/blob/main/stack-navigation/index.html)

Build a navigation component that displays the list of previously visited pages as well as a back button which lets the user go back to the previous page.

Your solution should display a navigation with four links, a history list that displays the previously visited pages, a current page paragraph which displays the name of the currently displayed page, and a go back button which, when clicked, navigates to the previously visited page.

Here are some additional error boundaries to think about:
What happens if you don’t have any previously visited pages?
What happens if you’re already on a page and you try navigating to it?

Expand your solution to be able to navigate forwards as well as backwards.
